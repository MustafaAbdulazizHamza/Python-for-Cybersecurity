## Assignments by Lecture

### The Second Lecture - Cryptography

Write a Python program with the following features:

1. **Database Creation**: The program should create a database called `Company` and a table called `Users` inside the database. The `Users` table should contain the following attributes: `User ID`, `Username`, and `Password`. It should fill the `Users` table with one record based on user input.

2. **Record Insertion**: The program should also allow inserting a new record into the `Users` table without attempting to recreate the database.

3. **Command-line Input**: The program should accept user input as command-line arguments.

4. **Encryption and Hashing**: The program should encrypt the `Username` using MultiFernet cryptography and hash the `Password` using any chosen hashing algorithm.

5. **Decryption Key Storage**: The data required to decrypt the `Username` should be automatically saved into files in the Current Working Directory (CWD) so that an optional lab script called `login` can work.

### The Third Lecture - Data Visualization

Dr. Watson gave Sherlock Holmes the secret data he requested in CSV format. This data includes information about criminals and the four crimes of interest they committed, with each criminal associated with a single crime. Sherlock needs to visualize this data to interpret it. Suggest a Python program that performs this task.

**Note**: The CSV file is called `crimes.csv` and is uploaded alongside this file.

### The Eighth Lecture - Web Scraping

Create a web scraper that extracts quotes from Goodreads and stores them in JSON format.
